MotionKit Example Application
=============================

This is a minimal RubyMotion App, intended to demonstrate a simple layout.
The layout is once done in the 'traditional' iOS way and once using the MotionKit gem.

The only other dependency I added was BubbleWrap to make including an image from the resources folder easier.

## Local Setup
  * Make sure RubyMotion is correctly installed
  * Clone the repository into a local folder: ```git clone git@github.com:jhmegorei/motionkit-example.git```
  * Enter folder: ```cd motionkit-example```
  * install the dependencies: ```bundle install```
  * run the rake task to compile the app and run it in the simulator: ```rake```

Read the comments in the example controller to see what to comment out for each layout.
